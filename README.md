# LIS 572, Autumn 2022
My work for LIS 572 Foundations of Data Science: Applications in Library Science and Digital Humanities, in the MLIS program at the University of Washington.

I took this course in my first quarter of the MLIS program, with Melanie Walsh as my instructor. I learned a lot about how to do data analysis for DH!

All work pulled from the assignments here: https://github.com/melaniewalsh/lis572-au22
