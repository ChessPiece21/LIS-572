The final blog is located here: https://medium.com/@joelollo/cheers-love-the-analysts-here-using-data-science-methods-to-assess-overwatch-2-play-rates-c996e3ceb065

The assignments are located on this GitHub repository, as are the non-interactive data visualizations. The interactive ones can be found on [my Plotly Chart Studio repository](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~JoeLollo21).

If you want to play around with the data, it is located in the "ow2-2022.csv" file.
